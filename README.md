Height Catcher
==============
An Androind application that is designed to identifty malnutrition in infants by recording
their height using the camera of an Android device. The user can then create reference points
on the resulting image that will be compared to a given reference object to estimate the height
of the person in the image.

From knowing a persons height, weight and age it is then possible to assess whether they are
suspect to malnutrition.
